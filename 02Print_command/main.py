# 1 ------------To print a String we can use ""(double Quotation) or ''(Single Quotation) else ''' '''(Triple Quotation)--------------
# print("Hello World")
# print('Hello World2')
# print('''Hello world3''')
# print('''Hi,
#     I am Joy. I am Currently in USA.''') # But Triple is mainly used when we have to print something which has Multiple line.


# 2 Note.
# Everytime when we use Print function it print the Given string But it send the Cursor to next line so the next print Statement will print the line on new line but if we want 2 print Function to print the string in One line then we have to use end="" (here it means print the string but there is no need to go to nextline there will zerowhitespace so the next print function will print Immediate next to it.

# Example
print("Joy")
print("Christian")
print("-------------------------------")
# After using end=""
print("Joy", end=" ")
print("Christian")
# here end="" as between qutotation Mark there is No space if put one space then it print Joy Christian u can put anything there make it blank or a single white or multi spaces or - or _ anyting u want u can put there.
print("Joy", end="      ")
print("Christian")

# Last Thing
# we can Also write like this . the comma will create one white space there.
print("Jay Rajput")
